8 lesson introduction to programming with python or JS.

This document describes fictional 8 lesson structure for teaching basics of programming to upper elementary school students.



## Topics of the lessons
* 1 - Introduction, turtle, syntax
* 2 - Simple functions, drawing
* 3 - Functions with parameters, variables
* 4 - Moving objects, control sequences, boolean logic
* 5 - Iteration, randomization
* 6 - Controls and gamification
* 7 - tbd
* 8 - tbd


Tools:

* [Turtle roy](https://turtle-roy.herokuapp.com/) - Simple roy drawing
* [Code club](https://codeclub.firebaseapp.com/) - Turtle with Python
* [MatterJS physics](http://brm.io/matter-js/) - JS library for physics and game engine stuff
* [Write-a-game](http://write-a-game.herokuapp.com/)
* Some js based equivalent, what?

Example single lesson structure
 * Introduction to theory, examples
 * coding and more coding exercises individually
 * going through exercises?
 * Homework and/or more links for more work (can be also used as material if students run out of exercises during lesson)
 * Show something cool in the internets that uses some concepts taught here


### 1. Introduction
Key concepts:

* Learning the tools
* Some grasp of syntax 
* Simple drawing of lines and turns

Example of excercises
* Draw a box
* Draw the first letter of your name, or your whole name


### 2. Simple functions
Key concepts:

* Drawing shapes with functions
* How to define a function?
* What is function?

Example of excercises

* Draw a robot or figure with shapes
* Write a function for drawing square, pentagon, hexagon etc


### 3. Parameters and variables
Key concepts:

* Drawing shapes with PARAMETRIZED functions
* What is a variable?

Example of excercises

* How to parametrize square, pentagon, hexagon etc.
* Making calculations with variables, simple calculator


### 4. Booleans and control
Key concepts:

* Simple logic, what is true and what is false?
* this could need a loop based runtime, rather than turtle-kind-of-slow-drawing?

Example of exercises:
* Move a turtle to right, while dodging the obstacles
* App for 
* Make turtle move and always change direction when it hits certain x/y values


### 5. Iteration
Key concepts:

* Drawing lots of stuff with big iterations
* What happens if we add randomization to iterations?
* Can be done with turtle or loop gfx

Example of exercises

* Drawing lots of stuff


### 6. Controls
Key concepts:

* Runtime control of something
* Games as a topic?
*
