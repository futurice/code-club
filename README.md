8 lesson introduction to programming with python or JS.

This document describes a fictional 8 lesson structure for teaching basics of programming to upper elementary school students.


## Topics of the lessons
* 1 - Introduction, turtle, syntax - luvut ja laskutoimitukset, booleanit?
* 2 - Simple functions, drawing - geometria, koordinaatisto(7)
* 3 - Functions with parameters, variables - funktiot(8)
* 4 - Moving objects, control sequences, boolean logic - yhtälö&epäyhtälö(9)
* 5 - Iteration, randomization
* 6 - Controls and gamification
* 7 - tbd
* 8 - tbd


Tools:

* [Turtle roy](https://turtle-roy.herokuapp.com/) - Simple roy drawing
* [Code club](https://codeclub.firebaseapp.com/) - Turtle with Python, see in [Github](https://github.com/futurice/PythonInBrowser)
* [MatterJS physics](http://brm.io/matter-js/) - JS library for physics and game engine stuff
* [Write-a-game](http://write-a-game.herokuapp.com/)
* Some js based equivalent, what?

Example of single lesson structure

 * Introduction to theory, examples
 * coding and more coding exercises individually
 * going through exercises?
 * Homework and/or more links for more work (can be also used as material if students run out of exercises during lesson)
 * Show something cool in the internets that uses some concepts taught here


### 1. Introduction
Key concepts:

* Learning the tools
* Some grasp of syntax 
* Simple drawing of lines and turns

Example of excercises

* Draw a box
* Draw the first letter of your name, or your whole name

Step by step TODO

* Esittäytyminen, who is who, miksi tehdään näin (tehdään kaikille kouluille, testataan tässä)
* työkalu, opeta codeclub, eri ikkunat, anna oppilaiden räpläillä parametreja
* käy läpi mitä komennot tekee oppilaiden kanssa
* 


### 2. Simple functions
Key concepts:

* Drawing shapes with functions
* How to define a function?
* What is function?

Example of excercises

* Draw a robot or figure with shapes
* Write a function for drawing square, pentagon, hexagon etc


### 3. Parameters and variables
Key concepts:

* Drawing shapes with PARAMETRIZED functions
* What is a variable?

Example of excercises

* How to parametrize square, pentagon, hexagon etc.
* Making calculations with variables, simple calculator


### 4. Booleans and control
Key concepts:

* Simple logic, what is true and what is false?
* this could need a loop based runtime, rather than turtle-kind-of-slow-drawing?

Example of exercises:

* Move a turtle to right, while dodging the obstacles
* Make turtle move and always change direction when it hits certain x/y values
* Have array of numbers [0, 3, 2, 5, 8, 10, 2, 1], draw an array of boxes with color responding to the numbers (for example blue for <5, red for >=5) - might need iteration?


### 5. Iteration
Key concepts:

* Drawing lots of stuff with big iterations
* What happens if we add randomization to iterations?
* Can be done with turtle or loop gfx
* random size, movement, color etc

Example of exercises

* Drawing lots of stuff
* Going through array
* How big number do you get if you add 100 random numbers together?
* Drawing looping graphics, like a wall of squares


### 6. Controls
Key concepts:

* Runtime control of something
* Games as a topic?
* 

Example of exercises

* Drawing lots of stuff
